React Router takes in the page name/number from the route
Parent React (Router) component checks its array of loaded pages
const loadedIndices = pages.map((obj)=>{return obj.pageName;})
Of the requested page name/number is not in the loaded indices, request it from the server
(Set up CORS in order to pull images from flask to react)
const requestedIndex = '1';
const isRequestedAlreadyLoaded = loadedIndices.includes(requestedIndex);
Store the server-retrieved image in the array of loaded pages
Inside the render function, generate the array of routes from the array of loaded pages
Reader component is given the proper image via routing and props
The props variable is an image blob or <img> tag that contains the blob
Reader then allows the user to navigate within the given image to do stuff



***The array of loaded pages should be part of the router's state so that it will automatically trickle down
    *** the correct image to the Reader child
